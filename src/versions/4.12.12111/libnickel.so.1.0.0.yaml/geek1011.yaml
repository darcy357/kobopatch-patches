Rename new home screen footer:
  - Enabled: no
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Find your next great read", Replace: "25 character string      "}
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Buy, borrow, or preview books", Replace: "29 character string          "}

Set slide to unlock:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Swipe to unlock is enabled by default for the Kobo Forma. This patch allows
      you to enable/disable swipe to unlock for any device.
  # In the subroutine where the AbstractPowerView (used for swipe to unlock) is instantiated:
  # pre-4.11.12111: change Device::isFrost() to a MOV instruction to set true/false
  # 4.11.12111+: change PowerSettings::getUnlockEnabled() (to override the hidden config setting [PowerSettings] -> UnlockEnabled)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9CF344, FindH: 58 F6 DE E7, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9CF346, FindH: 01, ReplaceH: 00} # 00 to disable, 01 to enable

Enable rotation on all devices:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Enables rotation on all devices. This shows a rotation icon in the status
      bar, which shows a menu allowing you to choose between portrait and landscape
      when pressed. This icon is only shown on rotateable views (like the reader).
  # In MainWindowController::allowLandscapeRotation, which is called when building the status bar:
  # change Device::isFrost() to MOV r0, 0x1 to set true all the time
  # NOTE: when updating this patch, make sure this doesn't try and enable the MMA8652 sensor
  #       as of 4.11.11980, there is an additional check where the sensor is enabled, and this
  #       will fail gracefully, removing the auto-rotate option from the status bar menu.
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x964370, FindH: AD F6 12 E0, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}

Both page turn buttons go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Make both page turn buttons on the Forma go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent*):
  # nop the possible branch to prev page, falling through to the next page no matter what.
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9D8C5E, FindH: 2E B1, ReplaceH: 00 46}

Both page turn sides go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Make both page turn sides go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::processTap(TapGesture*):
  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9DFF08, FindH: 18 B9, ReplaceH: 00 46}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0xc) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x10) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,
  # instead of storing each one, just store forward (by changing the source register in the str
  # instruction)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9DFF0E, FindH: 3B 61, ReplaceH: 3A 61}
  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

Rename settings:
  - Enabled: no

  # and replace the call to UpgradeManager::isSilent to be always false (MOV r0, #0x0)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xACE2CA, FindH: 46 F5 FA E3, ReplaceH: 4F F0 00 00}
